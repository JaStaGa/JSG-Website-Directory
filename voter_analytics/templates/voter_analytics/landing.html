        This app allows you to inspect voter analytics. Through the creation of this app, I learned how to use filtering
        and plotly graphs to analyze data more carefully.

        You can view the <a href="{% url 'voters' %}">Voter List</a> to see all voters, or check out the <a
            href="{% url 'graphs' %}">Voter Graphs</a> to visualize voter data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the filters to narrow down the voter list based on various criteria such as party affiliation, date of
        birth, and more.
