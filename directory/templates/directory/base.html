      <div class="project-card">
        <h2>2KHub</h2>
        <h3>MyPlayer Build Planner</h3>
        <p>
          Tired of the VC grind? 2KHub helps you plan the ultimate NBA2K25 MyPlayer build before you even spend a dime.
          Select your dream badges and it calculates the exact height and attribute requirements. Built with Django
          models, forms, and class-based views; data smoothly transitions between SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in
          production; styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a polished, responsive experience.

        <h2>FriendZone</h2>
        <h3>Social Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          Ever wanted a lightweight social network just for fun? FriendZone lets you sign up, craft your profile, post
          status updates with images, add friends, and explore a personalized news feed. Powered by Django’s
          authentication and FileField for media storage, it leverages ListView and DetailView for clean, maintainable
          code.

      <!-- Voter Analytics -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h2>Voter Analytics</h2>
        <h3>Election Insights</h3>
        <p>
          Dive into US election data with Voter Analytics. I combined Django ORM with Pandas for robust data processing
          and rendered interactive Plotly charts to visualize trends by state and year. Filter and explore key metrics
          in real time—perfect for data enthusiasts.

        <h2>Lil Wayne Quote Machine</h2>
        <h3>Random Quote Generator</h3>
        <p>
          Get inspired by random Lil Wayne lyrics on demand. This app uses Django REST Framework to serve quotes stored
          in PostgreSQL via JSON endpoints, and a vanilla JavaScript front end makes AJAX calls to pull fresh quotes
          without page reloads.
